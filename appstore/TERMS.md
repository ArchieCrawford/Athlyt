# Terms of Service (Placeholder)

This is a placeholder document. Replace with your hosted Terms of Service and keep the URL consistent in App Store Connect and the app.

Required steps:
1) Finalize the Terms of Service text (legal/README.md references your current drafts).
2) Host it at a public URL (https://mytayp.com/terms).
3) Set EXPO_PUBLIC_TERMS_URL to that URL.
4) Paste the same URL into App Store Connect.

If you already host the terms, replace this file with the final text for your records.
